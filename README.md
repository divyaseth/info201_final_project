# Welcome to our Info 201 Final Project
We are Linli, Joanna, Yuichi, and Divya. Together we have created a report that explores world nutritional data with different  indicators such as country income level and life expectancy. This `README.md` file will take you through how you should read our report.

*Page 1*

The first page of our report takes an extensive look at the relationship between life expectancy and diet within different countries of the world. Users can select a year for which they want to view data for.

*Page 2*

The second page of our report shows a bar graph which shows a visual correlation between
calorie and/or sugar intake and income level of country. Users can select a year for which they want to view data for.

*Page 3*

The third page of our report shows a a table that has the standard deviations for the average nutritional intake (calorie and sugar) for each countries within specific regions. This standard deviation is telling of the inter-regional differences in nutritional intake.

*Page 4*

The final part of our report is a scenario case study which uses data analysis to analyze a real world situation. We chose to focus on the Horn of Africa food crisis from 2011-2012. Here the user can select to either see the change in life expectancy throughout Sub-Saharan Africa during this time or sugar intake. Different colors shed light on which parts of the region were impacted the most.
